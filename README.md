# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms – Pattern-Based Learning

This repository documents my **daily, structured practice of Data Structures and Algorithms** using a **pattern-oriented problem-solving approach**.

The focus is not on memorizing solutions, but on **recognizing patterns, building intuition, and applying concepts across problem variations**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Learn to identify reusable DSA patterns
- Write clean and optimized solutions
- Maintain daily consistency and discipline

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach
- Break problems into recognizable patterns
- Start with brute force, then optimize
- Focus on time and space complexity
- Write clear explanations along with code

---

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
Each folder represents **one day of learning** and contains:
- Pattern overview
- Problems solved
- Source code with explanations
- Key insights and learnings

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking
- Daily commits to maintain consistency
- Incremental improvement over time
- Refactoring older solutions when needed

---

## 🗓️ Commitment
**100 Days of disciplined DSA practice**  
Learning in public. Improving every day.
